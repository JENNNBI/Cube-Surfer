Stacking Cubes (Mechanic)

This fundamental mechanic might have made some companies millionaires. So I wanted to give it a try myself as well. I haven't moved my player with Raycast. My input system is shown in the scripts. Finally, you can collect points with w,a,d keys.
After some reflection, I realized that I am not able to complete this project at the moment.

That is a weak spot of mine that I aim to fix. There is also a bug in this game I need to work on.
